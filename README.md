# CartClient

## üìç Entry Point
`CartClient` serves as the main entry point for this service.

---

## üß† Assumptions

1. The service is expected to evolve with complex functionalities beyond basic CRUD operations.
2. Currency used is **INR**.
3. Tax policy is **dynamic** and may change in the future.
4. If a duplicate product is added to the cart, its **quantity is incremented**, not duplicated.
5. The cart is **persisted**.
6. **Validations**:
    - Cart size must be between `0` and `50`.
    - Quantity per product must be between `0` and `50`.
    - **Invalid products** are not allowed.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Trade-offs

- The **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** aggregate pattern introduces additional abstraction and complexity compared to a traditional transaction script pattern.
- However, this trade-off offers **greater flexibility** and **future extensibility**, making it worthwhile for long-term maintainability.

## üî≠ Out of Scope / Future Enhancements

1. Logging mechanisms
2. Error handling with custom wrapper exceptions (e.g. `DataNotFound`, `InvalidInput`)
3. Publishing domain events such as:
    - `CartCreated`
    - `ItemAdded`
    - `ItemQuantityUpdated`
4. Implementation of the persistence layer
5. Configuration-driven values
6. Mapper classes for transforming between DTOs and VOs

## ü§ñ AI Tool Usage

- **Specific Use Cases**: Code generation based on textual prompts
- **Estimated Code Generated by AI**: ~80%

### üîç Review Process for AI-Generated Code:

1. Generated classes were compared against class diagrams for accuracy.
2. Verified that behaviors and state management aligned with domain expectations (e.g., using a `Money` value object instead of a raw field for price).
3. Ensured proper **separation of concerns** (e.g., tax policies are dynamically applied, not hardcoded).
4. Manual code review was conducted for both:
    - Business logic
    - Test case correctness
5. Critical thinking applied by asking questions such as:
    - "Does this implementation make sense?"
    - "Does it belong in this module?"
    - "Is this the most appropriate way to model this behavior?"
